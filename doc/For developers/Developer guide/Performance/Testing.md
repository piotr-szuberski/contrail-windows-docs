Contrail Windows Performance Testing
====================================

This document describes assumptions, utilized tools and conclusions drawn from performance tests of Contrail on Windows Server 2016.

## Introduction

TCP throughput was measured in the following scenarios:

1. Raw Windows Server network stack (abbreviated `Raw` in _Results_ section).
1. Windows Server containers (WinSrv containers) on 2 compute nodes (abbreviated `Containers` in _Results_ section).
1. WinSrv containers on 1 compute node (abbreviated `Colocated Containers` in _Results_ section).
1. WinSrv containers on 2 compute nodes, with Contrail Windows (abbreviated `Containers w/ Contrail` in _Results_ section).
1. WinSrv containers on 2 compute nodes, traffic tuned to eliminate TCP segmentation (abbreviated `Containers (no seg)` in _Results_ section).
1. WinSrv containers on 2 compute nodes, with Contrail Windows, traffic tuned to eliminate TCP segmentation (abbreviated `Containers w/ Contrail (no seg)` in _Results_ section).

Test results and scenarios are described in the following sections.

## Conclusions

Conclusions:

- Enabling Hyper-V on Windows Server 2016 reduces TCP throughput by a factor of 3-4.
    - Reduced throughput can be explained by lack of support for VMQ in vmxnet3 adapters.
- Difference between TCP throughput scenario where containers are colocated and scenario where containers are on separate nodes, suggests that VMSwitch is a bottleneck.
- Comparing `Containers (no seg)` test with `Containers w/ Contrail (no seg)` shows that vRouter code paths could account for 50-60% drop in TCP throughput.

Performance baseline for Contrail Windows should be based on network performance of containers running on Hyper-V.


## Test environment assumptions

Performance is evaluated on 2 VMware virtual machines.
Virtual machines should have the following specs:

- VMware Virtual Machine version 13,
- CPU: 2 vCPU,
- RAM: 4 GB,
- Storage: 50 GB HDD (VMware Paravirtual SCSI),
- NIC1: 1Gb (Emulated E1000E),
- NIC2: 10Gb (VMXNET3).

Both virtual machines should be spawned on the same ESXi.
NIC1 is used as a MANAGEMENT plane adapter and can be attached to any vSwitch.
NIC2 is used as a CONTROL and DATA adapter and it should be attached to vSS created solely
for performance testing.
This vSS should not have any physical NICs attached.
