# Limitations and known issues

## Workarounds

* On Windows Server 2016, NAT network on compute node must be disabled in order for IP packet fragmentation to work. 

## Deployment

* Nano Server running as Compute Node is currently not supported, as it lacks the ability to install Hyper-V networking extensions.
* Windows 10 is not supported due to it having a different version of Docker (Community, instead of Enterprise).

## Container networking

* Currently only Windows Server containers are supported, due to differences in network handling with Hyper-V Containers. 
* Multiple config nodes not supported in Docker Driver.
* Multiple endpoints per container are not supported.
* Multiple IPs/networks per container endpoint are not supported.
* `docker network inspect` on Contrail network does not show correct IPAM subnet, if subnet was not specified on creation
